# ChatOps Guard

A security and monitoring tool for ChatOps environments that helps protect and control chat-based operations.

## Overview

ChatOps Guard is designed to provide security, monitoring, and access control for ChatOps (Chat Operations) workflows. It helps organizations safely implement chat-based automation by providing guardrails and security measures for bot interactions and automated processes.

**Flow Description:**
1. **Input**: Users send commands through various chat platforms
2. **Parsing**: Commands are parsed and structured by ChatOps Guard
3. **Security Pipeline**: Commands pass through multiple security layers:
   - Access control validates user permissions
   - Rate limiting prevents abuse
   - Command filtering validates syntax and content
   - Security validator performs final checks
4. **Execution**: Approved commands are forwarded to backend systems
5. **Logging**: All activities are logged for audit and monitoring
6. **Monitoring**: Dashboard and alerts provide real-time visibility

## Features

- **Access Control**: Manage who can execute specific ChatOps commands
- **Audit Logging**: Track and log all ChatOps activities for compliance and security
- **Command Filtering**: Filter and validate commands before execution
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through configurable rate limits
- **Integration Ready**: Easy integration with popular chat platforms and CI/CD tools
